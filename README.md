# Daily Scheduler
## Description
This project is a web application that allows people to enter their schedule online in an organized fashion. This daily scheduler provides 24 separate sections that represent a different hour in a day. Each of these sections have an area where the user can enter tasks or events that will or have occured in that section's respective hour. The first section, or time block, starts at 1 AM and the last one ends at 12 AM. All events and tasks can be saved by clicking the blue lock-button adjacent to each event. Due to the functions that store the users input into local storage, these changes will be maintained even if the website reloads. The website also features elements that update automatically. The date will always reflect the current date. Meanwhile, the time blocks are color-coded in order to reflect which hours have past, which hour it is, and the hours that are left in the day. Past hours are colored gray, the present hour is colored red, and the future hours are colored green. Making this project helped me feel more comfortable with dayjs. I feel I know how to apply it and manipulate it so that it could keep elements up-to-date. This project also helped me get more familiar with the different jquery methods and the syntax that needs to be used. I also learned a lot about setting and getting local storage data.
